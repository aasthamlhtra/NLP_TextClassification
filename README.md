# NLP Text Classification (Using Recurrent Neural Networks)


This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing text classification using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implemented with PyTorch.

## Notebook: `RNNClassification.ipynb`

### Features
- Preprocessing of text data
- Tokenization and sequence padding
- Vocabulary creation and embedding lookup
- Implementation of a simple RNN model using PyTorch
- Training and evaluation loop with accuracy and loss tracking
- Visualization of results

### Requirements

Install the necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib
